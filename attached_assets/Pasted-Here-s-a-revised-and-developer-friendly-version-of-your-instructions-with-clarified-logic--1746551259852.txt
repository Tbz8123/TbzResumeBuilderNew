## ‚úÖ Feature Request & Bug Report Summary for Developer Panel & Resume Templates

---

### **üß© Step 1: Fix TemplateEngine Error (Screenshot 1 Reference)**

**Issue:** The `TemplateEngine.tsx` component is throwing an error (shared in Screenshot 1).
**Action:**

* Investigate the runtime or type error in the file.
* Ensure proper props and types are passed.
* Confirm any custom hooks or components used inside `TemplateEngine.tsx` are functioning correctly.

---

### **üíæ Step 2: Fix Data Save Issue in Developer Mode**

**Issue:** Data entered in developer mode is **not saving properly**. When navigating away and returning to the template page, it resets to default data instead of showing saved input.
**Expected Behavior:**

* The developer‚Äôs entered content (HTML, CSS, meta info, etc.) should persist.
* On return to the template page, the last-saved data should load, not default placeholders.
  **Action:**
* Verify that the save function writes to the correct backend or state.
* Fix the state restore mechanism on template load.

### **üîò Step 3: Enable/Disable Code Blocks with Developer Control**

**Issue:** Multiple code blocks (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) are visible in developer mode, but there‚Äôs no way to control their visibility individually.
**Request:**

* Add toggle switches for each code section (HTML, CSS, JS).
* Only **enabled code blocks** should be used for the template display.
* Developer should be able to enable/disable any code section dynamically.
  **Action:**
* Add a toggle (e.g., checkbox or switch) next to each code editor.
* Store and reflect the enabled/disabled state.
* Ensure the frontend only uses enabled sections for rendering.

### **üìé Step 4: Add PDF Upload & Control in Developer Mode**

**Issue:** There is **no option to remove or disable** uploaded PDFs in developer mode. Currently, only a greyed-out preview is shown.
**Request:**

* Allow developers to:

  * Upload a new PDF.
  * Remove an existing one.
  * Enable or disable PDF preview.
    **Action:**
* Add buttons: "Upload PDF", "Remove PDF", "Enable/Disable Preview".
* If disabled, PDF should not appear on the homepage.
* Reflect enabled PDFs in the frontend template cards.

---

### **üìè Step 5: Add Advanced Scaling Controls for Resume Preview Cards**

**Issue:** The resume preview card on the homepage does not scale correctly. Scrollbars appear, and the layout is clipped.
**Request:**

* Provide **advanced scaling controls** in the developer mode:

  * Set **custom width and height** for the preview.
  * Adjust **scaling (zoom/transform)** factor.
  * Choose **cross-axis scaling** behavior (maintain aspect ratio vs. fill container).
    **Action:**
* Add inputs or sliders in developer mode for:

  * `width`, `height`, `scale`, and `aspectRatio`
* Apply those settings to the preview container (`transform: scale()` or CSS `zoom`).
* Store settings and reflect them in both backend preview and homepage frontend.

Would you like me to draft the **UI wireframe or mockup suggestions** for how these toggles and controls should appear in developer mode?
