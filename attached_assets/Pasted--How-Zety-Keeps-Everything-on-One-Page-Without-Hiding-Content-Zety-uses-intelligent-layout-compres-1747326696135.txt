ðŸ§  How Zety Keeps Everything on One Page Without Hiding Content
Zety uses intelligent layout compression â€” instead of hiding anything, they dynamically scale and reflow content to always fit within a single A4/Letter page.

âœ… 1. They Use Auto-Scaling Logic
When content exceeds a page:

Font sizes get slightly smaller (e.g., from 14px to 12px)

Line heights get tighter (e.g., 1.6 â†’ 1.3)

Margins and paddings shrink

Section titles might switch from uppercase + large font to something smaller

Multi-column layouts adjust column widths

This process is done programmatically, in real-time, via JavaScript and/or server-side rendering logic.

âœ… 2. Everything is Inside a Fixed Container
Their resume templates are rendered inside a fixed-height "page" container, e.g.:

css
Copy
Edit
.resume-page {
  width: 210mm;
  height: 297mm;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
}
Then, JavaScript measures the content height, and if it exceeds the page height, it shrinks the entire resume layout proportionally â€” think of it like using transform: scale(0.95) until it fits.

âœ… 3. Canvas or PDF Rendering
Most modern resume builders (Zety, Canva, Novoresume) render to PDF or canvas behind the scenes â€” so they control exact print output via tools like:

Puppeteer (headless Chrome)

jsPDF with html2canvas

WeasyPrint or wkhtmltopdf (server-side)

This allows precise layout control beyond what's possible with raw HTML+CSS alone.

ðŸ§ª Try This Yourself (Proof of Concept)
You can mimic this "shrink-to-fit" behavior using CSS and a bit of JavaScript:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="resume-page" id="resume">
  <!-- Resume content -->
</div>

<script>
  const page = document.getElementById('resume');
  const maxHeight = 1122; // A4 in pixels at 96 DPI (~297mm)
  
  const scaleToFit = () => {
    let scale = 1;
    while (page.scrollHeight > maxHeight && scale > 0.6) {
      scale -= 0.01;
      page.style.transform = `scale(${scale})`;
      page.style.transformOrigin = 'top left';
    }
  };

  window.onload = scaleToFit;
  window.onresize = scaleToFit;
</script>
This JavaScript script keeps scaling down your .resume-page until it fits an A4 page â€” similar to what Zety does!

âœ… Summary: How Zety Handles Large Resume Content on One Page
