1. Show an Interactive Template Preview with Highlighted Tokens
Render the raw HTML in a scrollable preview pane.

Overlay colored boxes around each placeholder token (e.g. [[FIELD:name]], [[LOOP:sections.education]]) so you can see exactly where they live in the layout.

When you click on a highlighted region, the corresponding placeholder token is auto-selected in your binding panel.

This gives you a “point-and-see” workflow: click on “John Doe” in the preview and the admin UI jumps to the name binding.

2. Two-Column Bindings Panel with Live Search & Filter
Left column: list of placeholder tokens found in the template (name, contact.email, [[LOOP:sections.experience]], etc.).

Right column: live search/filterable tree of your data fields (name, contact.phone, sections.education[].year, etc.).

Workflow:

Click a placeholder in the left list.

Type “edu” in the right tree’s search box to quickly find and select sections.education[].year.

The binding is saved immediately and the preview updates.

3. Wizard Mode for Linear Walk-Through
If the template is long, offer a “Next →” wizard that guides you placeholder by placeholder:

Step 1: “Bind your page title” → selects [[FIELD:name]] region/highlight → dropdown to choose name.

Step 2: “Bind your contact block” → jump to [[FIELD:contact.email]] → map to contact.email.

Step 3: “Bind your education loop” → preview snippet repeated n times → select sections.education array → map ITEM:year and ITEM:desc.

…and so on, until every token is mapped.

At the end you get a quick “100% complete” status.

4. Inline “Bind” Buttons in the Preview
Next to each placeholder in the HTML preview (perhaps via a subtle “⚙️” icon), show a small “Bind ▼” button:

html
Copy
Edit
<h1>[[FIELD:name]] <button class="bind-btn">Bind ▼</button></h1>
Clicking that drops open a mini-dropdown right there, listing your data fields.

Pick “name” and the button turns green.

Hover over it to see “Bound to: name.”

This inline approach makes it immediately obvious which bit of text you’re binding.

5. Auto-Suggest & Smart Defaults
When a new template is uploaded, run a quick heuristic:

If you see [[FIELD:name]], auto-select the name field for you.

If you detect a loop over sections.skills, auto-bind it to your skills array.

If placeholder and data keys match exactly, pre-populate the dropdown.

You then only need to tweak the few that didn’t match or add your custom sections.
