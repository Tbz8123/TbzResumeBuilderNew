I want to build a modular, centralized resume template engine like Zety‚Äôs, with the following features:

üß© Component Structure
Create a reusable, centralized resume template rendering component.

Each template should be built using editable HTML and CSS, not static images.

Make sure templates support live preview with editable fields (e.g., name, job title, summary, etc.).

Use scalable CSS classes (e.g., template-skin-01, template-skin-02) to easily apply different design themes.

üîÑ Preview Functionality
Implement live template previews using actual HTML and CSS.

Use CSS transforms (e.g., scale()) to display thumbnail versions of full templates in a selection UI.

Include a template switcher ‚Äì users should be able to apply a different template with a loading animation/transition.

Preload all template assets (CSS, fonts, background images) for instant switching and smooth UX.

‚úçÔ∏è Editable Fields & Real-time Updates
Allow users to input data (name, experience, education, etc.) through a form or editor.

Sync user input in real time with the template preview using two-way data binding or DOM updates.

Make each text block in the resume (e.g., <span class="field">) dynamic and data-driven.

üìÑ Export Capability
Build an endpoint to export the live HTML template into:

PDF using a server-side tool (like wkhtmltopdf, Puppeteer, or PDFKit).

DOCX using a server-side library (e.g., python-docx, OpenXML, or DocRaptor).

Optionally support TXT or JSON export of raw resume data.

üì¶ Asset & Layout Management
Store templates, CSS styles, and background images in a CDN or static asset folder.

Use modular SCSS or CSS-in-JS (if using React) for easy theming and layout control.

Optionally include Google Fonts or web-safe fonts for typography customization.

üíª Stack Suggestions (optional)
Frontend: React, Vue, or plain JavaScript + Bootstrap/Tailwind.

Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or ASP.NET for PDF/DOCX export.

PDF Generator: Puppeteer, wkhtmltopdf, or Playwright.

DOC Generator: docx for Python/Node, or OpenXML for .NET.

‚ôªÔ∏è Reusability
Design the template engine as a central module that can be embedded or reused on:

Resume Builder Page

Template Gallery Page

User Resume Preview Page

Admin/Moderation Panel

Ensure all styles and scripts are scoped and optimized for performance.
