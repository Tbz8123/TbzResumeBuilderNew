Multiple Processing Paths: The function processes work experience data in two different ways:

First, it creates simple text entries for all experiences

Then, it looks for specific template patterns and processes them again

Template-Specific Processing: The function has special handling for "Testing template" patterns that may not match your actual template structure, causing duplicate entries.

Temporary Entry Handling: The function attempts to handle temporary entries but may not be properly filtering them out in all cases.

Solution
Here's how to fix the duplicate work experience issue:

Modify the work experience processing section in templates-support.ts to:

typescript
// Process work experience entries
if (resumeData.workExperience && resumeData.workExperience.length > 0) {
  // Filter out temporary entries
  const realExperiences = resumeData.workExperience.filter((exp: any) => 
    !(typeof exp.id === 'string' && exp.id === 'temp-entry')
  );

  // Generate HTML for work experience section
  const workExpHtml = realExperiences.map((exp: any) => {
    const startDate = exp.startMonth && exp.startYear ? `${exp.startMonth} ${exp.startYear}` : '';
    const endDate = exp.endMonth && exp.endYear ? `${exp.endMonth} ${exp.endYear}` : '';
    
    const dateRange = exp.isCurrentJob 
      ? `${startDate} - Present` 
      : `${startDate}${endDate ? ` - ${endDate}` : ''}`;
    
    const description = exp.responsibilities || exp.description || '';
    
    return `
      <div class="work-experience-item">
        <h3>${exp.jobTitle || ''}</h3>
        <p class="company">${exp.employer || ''}</p>
        <p class="work-dates">${dateRange}</p>
        <p>${description}</p>
      </div>
    `;
  }).join('');

  // Replace the entire work experience section
  const workExpSectionRegex = /<div class="section">\s*<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE<\/h2>[\s\S]*?<\/div>/i;
  processedHtml = processedHtml.replace(
    workExpSectionRegex,
    `<div class="section">
      <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
      ${workExpHtml}
    </div>`
  );
}
Key Changes Made:
Simplified Processing: Removed the duplicate processing paths and consolidated into a single approach.

Better Section Replacement: Now replaces the entire work experience section at once rather than trying to match individual entries.

Strict Filtering: Ensures temporary entries are properly filtered out before processing.

Consistent HTML Structure: Maintains the same HTML structure as your template for proper styling.

Additional Recommendations:
Template Detection: Add logic to detect your specific template structure before applying transformations.

Debug Logging: Add more detailed logging to track how work experience data is being processed.

Data Validation: Add validation to ensure work experience data has required fields before processing.

This solution should prevent duplicate entries while maintaining all the functionality of your resume template. The work experience section will now only show each entry once, properly formatted according to your template's structure.
