You don’t need to write a single line of code to hook up your template—what you want is a visual binding interface in your admin console that does three things:

Discovers Template Placeholders

Lists Available Data Fields

Lets You “Map” One to the Other

Below is a high-level sketch of how that could look in your existing Templates page:

1. Detect & List Your Template’s Placeholders
When you upload your HTML, run a tiny parser on the backend (invisibly to you) that scans for tokens like {{ name }}, {{ contact.phone }}, {{ sections.skills }}, [[CUSTOM_SECTION_1]]—any marker you agree on.

In the admin UI, it then shows you a “Placeholders” panel:

Placeholder Token	Sample Value
{{ name }}	“Frans Denison”
{{ contact.email }}	“you@youremail.com”
{{ sections.about }}	“I’m a designer…”
[[CUSTOM_SECTION_1]]	“Volunteering”
…	…

2. Present Your Page’s Data Fields
Alongside, show a “Data Fields” panel listing exactly the same fields your resume builder form produces:

Data Key	Current Value
name	“Frans Denison”
contact.phone	“+123…”
sections.about	“I’m a designer…”
sections.skills[0].name	“Photoshop”
sections.customSections[1].items	["Mentoring","Blogging"]
…	…

3. Drag-and-Drop (or Dropdown) to Bind
Make each Placeholder row editable. Either:

Drag the Data Field onto the Placeholder,

Or click a small “Link” icon next to {{ name }} and select “name” from a dropdown.

When you do, the system records:

bash
Copy
Edit
bind "{{ name }}" ← sections.name  
bind "[[CUSTOM_SECTION_1]]" ← sections.customSections[0]
4. Save & Preview In-Place
Once you’ve mapped every placeholder, click “Save” and then “Preview” to see your template filled with real data—no code required.

You can re-open the binding UI anytime to re-map if you rename a field, add a new custom section, or tweak your template.

Unmapped placeholders can be highlighted in red so you always know if something’s missing.

Why This Works
Zero Coding for You: The admin UI does the parsing and the binding; you just point-and-click.

Full Flexibility: You can reorder sections, rename your tokens, even add new [[MY_TOKEN]] markers and immediately bind them to any data path.

Instant Feedback: A live preview shows you exactly which fields are feeding which parts of your design.

Next Steps
Decide on Your Placeholder Syntax: Handlebars-style {{…}}, bracket-style [[…]], or HTML data-field="…".

Build the Binding UI:

A table listing placeholders + dropdowns of data keys.

Drag-and-drop sidebar if you want a fancier UX.

Hook It Up on the Backend: Store a simple JSON map { token: dataPath }, then during render, replace each token with its bound data.

With that in place, anyone—even non-technical team members—can upload a fresh HTML template, click a few dropdowns, and have it instantly wired up to your resume builder’s data model.
